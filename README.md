# Summoners Wardrobe

Summoners Wardrobe is an e-shop powered by Blazor and written in C#, designed to facilitate the sale of digital goods (skins) inspired by the video game "League of Legends" by Riot Games. **Note:** This project does not sell or distribute actual skins. Instead, it provides a certificate of ownership in the form of a text file as a novelty item following a "purchase." 

The project leverages **Interactive Server Rendering** to deliver a smooth user experience and simplify the implementation of complex interactive components. Data is stored using a **SQLite database** with the help of **Entity Framework Core**, and the **MudBlazor CSS library** is used to create consistently styled and scalable UI elements.

---

## Features
- **Blazor Interactive Server Rendering** for responsive and dynamic user interfaces.
- **SQLite Database** for lightweight and efficient data storage.
- **Entity Framework Core** for database management and migrations.
- **Bootstrap CSS** for consistent and scalable styling.
- A simple e-commerce flow for purchasing digital certificates.

---

## First Launch

To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

In order to initialize the project, an empty SQLite database file must be placed within the following path:

/Parduotuve/Data/Store.db

Afterwards, in order to initialize the database, the following CLI command must be executed within the project path:

update-database

If the command executes without errors, the project is ready to be built and run!
---

## Configuration

- The location and name of the SQLite database file can be modified in the `appsettings.json` file located in the root directory of the project.
- The project currently contains placeholder credentials and an incomplete authentication system. **Do not use this project in a production environment.**

---

## Known Limitations
- Authentication and security features are incomplete and should not be relied upon.
- This project is intended for development and demonstration purposes only.

---

## Future Improvements
- Implement a secure and complete authentication system.
- Improve the certificate generation process.

---

## License
This project is for educational and demonstration purposes only. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by Riot Games.
